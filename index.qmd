# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to Advanced Time-Series and Spatial Ainalysis in Agriculture with R! This is a work in progress... I'll publish materials here as I create them. I warmly welcome community contributions in the form of discussions, suggestions, and edits. 

I also want these materials to be reusable and open. The sources are in the source [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jofou/TidySpatial) with a Creative Commons license attached (see below).

My intention is to write these materials and, when I feel I'm done, pick a publishing partner to produce a print version.

Certainly! Here's a paragraph summary for "Advanced Time-Series and Spatial Analysis in Agriculture with R":

"Advanced Time-Series and Spatial Analysis in Agriculture with R" is a comprehensive guide that equips readers with the skills to apply sophisticated data analysis techniques to agricultural datasets. The book delves into advanced topics such as multivariate time-series analysis, non-linear models, machine learning, spatio-temporal data integration, and high-performance computing. It provides practical examples and case studies to demonstrate the application of these methods in real-world agricultural scenarios, such as crop yield prediction, precision farming, and climate impact modeling. Designed for agronomists, data scientists, researchers, and advanced students, this book bridges the gap between traditional agricultural practices and modern data science, fostering innovation and enhancing decision-making in the agricultural sector.

## Intended Audience {.unnumbered}

This book is tailored for a diverse audience of professionals and academics who are engaged in the field of agricultural data analysis. It is ideal for agronomists, data scientists, and researchers looking to deepen their understanding of advanced statistical and machine learning techniques applied to agricultural datasets. Additionally, it serves as a valuable resource for graduate students and educators in agricultural science, environmental science, and data science programs, providing practical insights and hands-on experience with state-of-the-art analytical tools. Agricultural consultants, policymakers, and industry professionals will also find this book useful for making data-driven decisions that enhance productivity, sustainability, and resilience in agricultural practices.

To fully benefit from this book, readers should have a foundational understanding of both agriculture and data science. A basic proficiency in R programming is essential, as the book builds on this knowledge to introduce more advanced concepts and techniques. Familiarity with statistical methods and concepts such as regression, time-series analysis, and basic spatial analysis will be helpful. Additionally, a general understanding of agricultural practices and the types of data commonly encountered in this field (e.g., crop yields, weather patterns, soil characteristics) will provide context for the practical applications discussed. This book aims to bridge the gap between these disciplines, so a willingness to engage with both technical and agricultural content is key to mastering the material presented.

Before delving into the advanced techniques covered in this book, readers may benefit from exploring foundational texts that provide a solid grounding in both R programming and basic data analysis concepts. "R for Data Science" by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund is an excellent starting point, offering comprehensive coverage of data manipulation, visualization, and introductory statistical modeling using R. Additionally, "Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R" by Roger S. Bivand, Edzer Pebesma, and Virgilio GÃ³mez-Rubio provides a strong foundation in spatial data analysis, which is crucial for understanding the spatial components of agricultural data. For a thorough introduction to time-series analysis, "Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples" by Robert H. Shumway and David S. Stoffer is highly recommended. These texts will equip readers with the necessary skills and knowledge to fully engage with the advanced topics and practical applications presented in this book.

## How can I ask questions? 

If you have questions about the content, it is probably best to ask on a public forum, like [cross-validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/). You'll most likely get a faster answer there if you take the time to ask the questions in the best way possible.   

If you want a direct answer from me, you should follow [_Yihui's Rule_](https://yihui.org/en/2017/08/so-gh-email/): add an issue to GitHub (labeled as "Discussion") first. 

If you think there is a bug, please [file an issue](https://github.com/Jofou/TidySpatial/issues). 

## Can I contribute?  {.unnumbered}

Please feel free to improve the quality of this content by submitting **pull requests**. A merged PR will make you appear in the contributor list. It will, however, be considered a donation of your work to this project. You are still bound by the conditions of the license, meaning that you are **not considered an author, copyright holder, or owner** of the content once it has been merged in.

If you plan to do anything beyond fixing a typo, the best thing you can do is to [open an issue](https://github.com/Jofou/TidySpatial/issues) and discuss changes before you spend a lot of time doing them. 

If you don't have a lot of experience with git or GitHub, take a look at the wonderful [_Happy Git and GitHub for the useR_](https://happygitwithr.com/). 

If you want to contribute, some general advice is: 

 - Only check in the source files (qmd, yml, bib, pre-made image files, etc). Don't commit the rendered files. 
 - Keep the changes small in scope. If the overall change is larger, make a sequence of small pull requests. 
 - The edits cannot include exact code that is under another license (i.e., don't just copy/paste from R sources, etc.)
 - Respect the existing code formatting/linting (as heterogeneous as it is). 
 - Stick to using R for computations.  
 - Don't update software versions unless you have to. If you need to update or add something, use [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) (described below) to codify the software requirements.  
 - The [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package has excellent tools for creating, updating, and managing pull requests. You should consider utilizing those features.
